// Package dfcad is a data-first CAD engine.
//
// A model is a declarative entity graph held in plain text files. The engine
// loads that graph, answers questions about it with the provenance and error
// budget behind every answer, edits it without losing either, and checks
// assertions over it.
//
// # Scope
//
// The engine is generic. The only vocabulary compiled in is a small closed set
// — node kinds and geometry forms. Everything domain specific arrives as
// registry data supplied by the consuming repository: types, claim predicates,
// frames, id namespaces and tolerances. A domain concept therefore never needs
// a change here, which is what keeps vocabulary growth reviewable.
//
// There is no database, no daemon and no network transport. The library is
// paired with a command line interface under cmd/dfcad, which is the intended
// entry point for scripts, CI and agents.
